# 📊 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project 🚀

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse & Analytics** repository!

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution using **SQL Server**, designed around modern best practices in **data engineering**. It covers the full lifecycle — from raw data ingestion to clean, business-ready datasets used for reporting, ad-hoc analysis, and machine learning.

## 🏗️ Data Warehouse Architecture

This project follows a **layered data architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold), enabling scalable, auditable, and analytics-friendly data pipelines.

### 🔶 Bronze Layer: Raw Data Ingestion

- **Purpose**: Stores raw data directly from source systems (e.g., CRM, ERP).
- **Source Format**: CSV files in folders.
- **Database Object Type**: Tables
- **Processing**:
  - Batch Processing
  - Full Load
  - Truncate & Insert
- **Transformations**: None (data is stored *as-is*)
- **Use Case**: Acts as a backup of source data and supports traceability.

---

### ⚪ Silver Layer: Cleaned & Standardized Data

- **Purpose**: Applies data cleansing, standardization, and normalization.
- **Database Object Type**: Tables
- **Processing**:
  - Batch Processing
  - Full Load
  - Truncate & Insert
- **Transformations**:
  - Data Cleansing
  - Standardization
  - Normalization
  - Derived Columns
  - Data Enrichment
- **Use Case**: Prepares data for business logic and reporting.

---

### 🟡 Gold Layer: Business-Ready Data

- **Purpose**: Curated data modeled for business intelligence and analytics.
- **Database Object Type**: Views
- **Processing**: No Load (views built over Silver Layer)
- **Transformations**:
  - Business Logic
  - Data Integration
  - Aggregation
- **Data Models**:
  - Star Schema
  - Flat Tables
  - Aggregated Tables
- **Use Case**: Consumed by BI tools, analysts, and machine learning applications.

---

## 📥 Data Sources

- **CRM & ERP Systems**
- **File Type**: CSV
- **Interface**: File-based ingestion

---

## 📈 Consumption Layer

Data is consumed through:

- 📊 Business Intelligence (Power BI, Tableau)
- 🔍 Ad-Hoc SQL Queries
- 🤖 Machine Learning Workloads

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Database**: SQL Server
- **ETL**: T-SQL, Stored Procedures
- **Modeling**: Star Schema, Aggregated Tables
- **Tools**: Power BI, Tableau (optional), SSMS
